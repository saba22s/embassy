This historical extension was not limited to administrative aspects alone, but extended to include deep cultural and social interactions that left their clear imprints to this day. With the dawn of the modern era, these relations took on new dimensions, embodied in firm political and diplomatic positions, most notably Turkey's steadfast and continuous support for the Palestinian cause and the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people."
