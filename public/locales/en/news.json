Tariq Zarab, in the Global Transport Connectivity Forum 2025 held in Istanbul over three days. The opening session featured speeches by the President of the Republic of Turkey, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and the Turkish Minister of Transport and Infrastructure, Abdulkadir Uraloğlu. Ambassador Dr. Mustafa's participation in this global forum, which brings together decision-makers and experts from most countries of the world, expresses a message of steadfastness and presence, and a genuine desire to build an open and interconnected future that respects the specificity of peoples and their right to live in freedom and dignity. Within the framework of this important forum, His Excellency the Ambassador participated in a special seminar on opportunities for regional cooperation in the field of transport in Central Asia, the Arab region, and Europe, which also included the participation of the Ministers of Transport and Communications of Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Ukraine. Ambassador Mustafa emphasized Palestine's openness to all forms of regional and international cooperation, reviewing the challenges facing the State of Palestine in this sector, which are primarily a result of the practices and measures of the occupying power, Israel, which still controls not only the external crossings of the State of Palestine but also movement within Palestine between cities, villages, and refugee camps, a matter that requires urgent international intervention."
